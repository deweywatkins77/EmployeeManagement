## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

## Usage

User will need to change the password for the mysql database in /lib/querys.js. Import the schema file located in /db/schema.sql. There is a seed file if you want to mess around with fake data. Once the program is running you can use the arrow keys to perform functions on the database.
